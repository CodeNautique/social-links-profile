## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I sharped my skills in coding in HTML and CSS, I developed this project very fast around 1h30min using figma to like a front-end developer do.

### Continued development

I have some difficulties to stick perfectly to the design, to  size the card perfectly and see no difference with the design. (see my others projects)
